### Story

Skorm was born on the Braveship Island, that sat in the shadow of a massive volcano. Life on the island was harsh, but Skorm was raised to be tough and hardworking from a young age. He spent his childhood helping his family tend to their farm and fishing boats, and honing his skills as a fighter in his free time.

As he grew older, Skorm felt the pull of the open sea. He was fascinated by the ships that passed by the island, and dreamed of one day exploring the world beyond his small community. So when he came of age, he left his family and his island behind and set out to become a sailor.

Skorm quickly proved himself to be a valuable member of any crew he joined. His size and strength made him a formidable fighter in any battle, and his hardworking nature meant that he was always willing to pitch in with whatever tasks needed doing on the ship. He loved the freedom of life at sea, and relished the opportunity to explore new lands and cultures.

However, Skorm's travels weren't always easy. He faced many dangers on the high seas, from storms and sea monsters to hostile pirates and rival sailors. But through it all, he remained steadfast and true to his values of hard work, honor, and loyalty.

Eventually, Skorm found himself as part of a crew that was tasked with transporting a valuable cargo to a distant land. But the journey was fraught with danger, and the ship was attacked by a band of ruthless pirates. Skorm fought bravely to defend his crewmates, but the battle was fierce and bloody.

In the end, Skorm was the only survivor. He washed up on the shores of one of the nearby islands, battered and bruised but still alive. With nowhere else to go, he decided to make a new life for himself in the land.

Skorm may be without a crew, but his Minotaur heritage and his Sailor background have prepared him well for whatever challenges lie ahead. He continues to seek adventure and new experiences, always striving to be a better fighter and a better sailor, and never forgetting the lessons he learned growing up on his island home.

Skorm's last crew was known as the "Sea Hawks". They were a tough and experienced group of sailors who specialized in transporting valuable cargo across the sea. Despite their rough exterior, they were a tight-knit group who valued loyalty and trust above all else. Skorm had been with the Sea Hawks for several years, and had developed a strong bond with his fellow crewmates. His loss weighed heavily on him, and he vowed to honor their memory by continuing to live his life with the same courage and determination they had shown in their final battle.
