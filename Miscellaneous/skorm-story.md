### Story

Skorm was born on the Braveship Island, that sat in the shadow of a massive volcano. Life on the island was harsh, but Skorm was raised to be tough and hardworking from a young age. He spent his childhood helping his family tend to their farm and fishing boats, and honing his skills as a fighter in his free time.

During his infancy, he was a very active child and was always getting into trouble and fights.

As he grew older, Skorm felt the pull of the open sea. He was fascinated by the ships that passed by the island, and dreamed of one day exploring the world beyond his small community. So when he came of age, he left his family and his island behind and set out to become a sailor.

Skorm quickly proved himself to be a valuable member of any crew he joined. His size and strength made him a formidable fighter in any battle, and his fighting skills were always getting improved by learning from each job and crew he met, and every drunk fight he would get into. His hardworking nature meant that he was always willing to pitch in with whatever tasks needed doing on the ship. He loved the freedom of life at sea, and relished the opportunity to explore new lands and cultures.

However, Skorm's travels weren't always easy. He faced many dangers on the high seas, from storms and sea monsters to hostile pirates and rival pirates. But through it all, he remained steadfast and true to his values of hard work, honor, and loyalty.

Eventually, Skorm found himself as part of a crew named 'Sea Hawks'. Basically, this is the crew Skorm spent most time with, and they were very closely bonded together.

The Sea Hawks did all sorts of transports and missions, and were a diverse crew, with different races and creeds. Mostly, the crew members were people who the society has rejected, or people looking for a second honest chance in life.

The captain of the Sea Hawks was called 'Hephoros', a dwarf that didn't spoke much, dead serious most of the time. He was although, a very passionate and loyal person, and the crew greatly respected him. Few knew his background, as he wasn't the talkative type.

Sea Hawks did business with a lot of different islands and patrons, but the ownership of the crew was mostly handled by a retired commander called Drael. Drael didn't sailed anymore as he grew old, but was dealing with all contracts and management to keep the crew busy with missions and jobs. He was a sailor throughout his life and loved the Sea Hawks as his own family.

Inside the crew, there was an Orc who was banned from the Sea Hawks for stealing cargo from the missions. His name was Hoh'Tur and he worked for months with the Sea Hawks before getting caught and judged. He fought with the crew a few times, and with Skorm as well. Hephoros kicked off Hoh'Tur after his fourth fight inside the crew, who later discovered he was also a thief.

Another noticible event during his time on the Sea Hawks, was during a regular route back to the HQ, Skorm noticed a body ashore. He rushed to save the man, who he later learned was called Vivur Borgen.

Vivur was found in critical state, but was treated by the crew and lived. Vivur then decided to join the Sea Hawks and worked alongside Skorm for a good time.

As a former noble, the adaptation for Vivur was difficult at the beggining, given that most of the crew were simple and uneducated, but he managed to get along, and do the work along his mates.

Skorm and Vivur had a great relationship during the time they worked together, and until Vivur left the crew for his own adventure, they worked, drank, fought and sailed together.

On their last mission, months after Vivur left, the Sea Hawks were tasked with transporting a valuable and mysterious cargo to a distant land. But the journey was fraught with danger, and the ship was attacked by a band of ruthless, but unusually professional and well-prepared pirates. Skorm fought bravely to defend his crewmates, but the battle was fierce and bloody.

In the end, Skorm was the only survivor. He washed up on the shores of one of the nearby islands, battered and bruised but still alive. With nowhere else to go, he decided to make a new life for himself in the land.

Unfortunately, Skorm never learned who those pirates were, what they were looking for, or even what the transported goods were. The experience was traumatic and his memories about it are scarse. This is a mystery that was always on the back of his mind.

Skorm may be without a crew, but his Minotaur heritage and his Sailor background have prepared him well for whatever challenges lie ahead. He continues to seek adventure and new experiences, always striving to be a better fighter and a better sailor, and never forgetting the lessons he learned growing up on his island home.

Skorm's last crew was known as the "Sea Hawks". They were a tough and experienced group of sailors who specialized in transporting valuable cargo across the sea. Despite their rough exterior, they were a tight-knit group who valued loyalty and trust above all else. Skorm had been with the Sea Hawks for several years, and had developed a strong bond with his fellow crewmates. His loss weighed heavily on him, and he vowed to honor their memory by continuing to live his life with the same courage and determination they had shown in their final battle.
